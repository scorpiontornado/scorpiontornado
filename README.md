### Hey! ðŸŒŠ

I'm Nicholas Langford, a 3rd-year Computer Science Coop Scholar at UNSW. I'm the Secretary of UNSWâ€™s Security Society (SecSoc), responsible for leading a team of 14 directors and a committee of ~50 alongside the other executives to deliver cybersecurity workshops, CTF competitions, social events, and more! I was also an IT Director for UNSW's Coop Society in 2024, in charge of the [website](https://coopsoc.com.au/), merch store / payment system, and other internal tools.

I have a passion for cybersecurity - I recently completed a cybersecurity internship at IAG, the largest general insurer in Australia & NZ. During my time there, I conducted cyberthreat intelligence work as part of the Threat Analytic Cell, as well as creating automations in Cybersecurity Engineering and a bit of pentesting. I'm also currently tutoring COMP6843 (Extended Web Application Security and Testing) at UNSW, where Iâ€™m responsible for single-handedly running weekly workshops and managing 40-50 students. In the past, Iâ€™ve also tutored COMP1521 (Computer Systems Fundamentals) and COMP1511 (Programming Fundamentals), teaching C, MIPS assembly, and systems programming.

I have a broad range of technological knowledge, including experience developing fullstack websites using Flask/Jinja2 and React/TS/NextJS (+ APIs with Flask & Express). One example is https://guidedctf.sec.edu.au, which was initially developed for a university assignment and later adapted for use in high schools in partnership with the NSW Department of Education. It has also been used in UNSW lectures teach hundreds of students about SQL injection. I also have an interest in theoretical computer science, having done research projects in AI and fractal image compression. Iâ€™ve also made an Alexa skill, love competitive programming, and much more!

Feel free to reach out for a chat anytime :)
